name: Deploy Next.js site to GitHub Pages
description: |
  This workflow builds and deploys a Next.js site to GitHub Pages.
  It uses the `actions/configure-pages` action to set up the environment for deployment.
  The workflow is triggered on pushes to the `main` branch and can also be run manually.
  The workflow includes steps to check out the code, set up Node.js, restore the cache, install dependencies,
  build the Next.js site, and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
  The deployment is done using the `actions/deploy-pages` action.
